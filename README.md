# Notice

This repository does not include the "models" folder. If you would like to download the sourcecode and run IntelliSleepScorer in your Python environment, you need to download the <a src="https://storage.googleapis.com/grins-public/LeiWang-20230208/IntelliSleepScorer.zip">IntelliSleepScorer Executable for Windows</a>, unzip it, and copy the "models" folder to the repositary. Otherwise, the software will crash due to missing model files.
